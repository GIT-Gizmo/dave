## About
Highly motivated frontend developer with an ardor for creating delightful user experiences with code. Balancing a healthy lifestyle with coding, I find inspiration in exploring new technologies and enjoy coding. When i'm not coding I will most likely be playing games, taking a walk, watching animes/movies, dancing or reading books. With a strong eye for detail, I strive to bring creativity and functionality to every project. Let's craft remarkable digital experiences together.
