  bio: <><p>Hello!, I'm Boluwatife David. A Full-Stack Engineer with a unique journey transitioning to software development. My background in demography fueled my analytical skills, which I now combine with expertise in React, Next.js, Node.js, and PHP to create cool web apps and robust systems.</p><p>Self-driven learning landed me my first freelance gig within 11 months, followed by internship role at Swap Space and contract role Adroit Handyman Services. At Adroit, I revamped the entire website which boosted server response time by 65% and user engagement by 20% and I'm constantly pushing boundaries with innovative solutions.</p><p>Beyond coding, I'm fascinated by Web 3.0's potential to improve user privacy and personalize experiences. Let's explore how I can bring your vision to life!</p>
