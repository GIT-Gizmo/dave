  bio: <><p>Hello, I'm Boluwatife David. A Full-Stack Engineer with a unique journey. My background in demography fueled my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. But my hunger for crafting impactful experiences led me to transition to web development in 2021.</p><p>Through self-driven learning, I mastered front-end technologies and landed my first freelance gig within 11 months. This kickstarted my career, leading me to SwapSpace as a front-end developer.</p><p>Now, as a full-stack engineer at Adroit Handyman Services, I leverage both front-end and back-end expertise to create engaging user interfaces and robust systems. My efforts have driven a 40% increase in sales and user engagement, and I'm constantly pushing boundaries with innovative solutions.</p></>,
